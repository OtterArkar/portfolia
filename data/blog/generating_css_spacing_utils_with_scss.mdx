### Spacing utilities !!



### _utilities.scss


All the naming collisions and as its hard to track where the specific rule comes from . Well I am gonna go with @use.




```sass
$dimensions :(
    "full":100%,
    "screen":100vh,
    "min":min-content,
    "max":max-content,
    // more and more
    "2/5": 40%,
    "3/5": 60%,
    "4/5": 80%,
    "1/6": 16.666667%,
    "1/3": 33.333333%,
    "1/2": 50%,
    "auto":auto,
);

```


In SASS, we can loop through the objects !
I started programming with python so it's seem so familiar to me

Cool !!




And its done !
I checked the output CSS file and good thing I am seeing these

We got the padding and now  for the rest all we have to do is add more values to our utility object.


I should have use better way for my values but that's fine I ended up with ctrl+c  and ctrl+v .

###@forward to spit out all my _partials

Currently now I have multiple partials in my utils folder ,good thing i can somehow gather them in a single file and spit out all these property together in a single index file .

So in my index.scss file
