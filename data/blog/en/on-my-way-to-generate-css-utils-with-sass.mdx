### Well I eventually fall in love 

with SASS after I tried several projects with it .

Also I am a fan of tailwind CSS so this is the blog about me trying learn more about SCSS while generating some utility classes with SCSS.

There is gonna be several episodes though out this way.

### So lets get started 

my apology first for my writing skill cause we all have language barriers.English is my second language.

## We all love [reloading](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41428954/what-is-the-difference-between-hot-reloading-and-live-reloading-in-react-native)

I thought that while building this thing , first thing comes to my mind is that would be nice if I don't have to refresh or reload manually every time I make changes to my files or compile my sass files.

After a few google searches , I found of course tons of methods I can use to setup my development server.

* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
* [parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
* [gulpjs] (https://gulpjs.com/)
* and many more.

## I found [Gulp] (https://gulpjs.com/) easy 

No more chit chat dive into the code and I started with a blank HTML file and I called it index.

### node modules !


```shell
npm init
npm install gulp gulp-sass sass
```

I waited a few seconds and it all works out perfectly well.

### gulp file ?

I found out on the internet that I need to make a gulp file to tell gulp what I want !

In this case , I need the ability to launch a local development server that reloads every times I press 
**ctrl-s** on my browser and of course compile my SASS.

Then I created a file called **gulpfile.js** in my project root which is basiclly a javascript and for some reasons they say I cannot [rename](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34099103/run-gulp-with-an-arbitrary-gulpfile-name-not-gulpfile-js/34099104) it.

```javascript
const { src, dest, watch, series } = require('gulp');
const sass = require('gulp-sass')(require('sass'));
const browserSync = require('browser-sync').create();

function buildScss() {
    return src('./utils/**/*.scss')
        .pipe(sass())
        .pipe(dest('css'))
        .pipe(browserSync.stream())
}

function watchTask() {
    watch(['./utils/**/*.scss'], buildScss)
    watch('./*.html').on('change', browserSync.reload)
    browserSync.init({
        server: './'
    })
}

exports.default = series(buildScss, watchTask)

```

Lets break down a bit of this code 


```javascript
const { src, dest, watch, series } = require('gulp');
const sass = require('gulp-sass')(require('sass'));
const browserSync = require('browser-sync').create();
```
Of course a little bit of imports and 

```javascript
function buildScss() {
    return src('./utils/**/*.scss')
        .pipe(sass())
        .pipe(dest('css'))
        .pipe(browserSync.stream())
}
```

This is the part responsible for compiling my SCSS files that I put them in one of my project folder called utils. 

```javascript
'./utils/**/*.scss'
```

double asterisks to make sure my SCSS files accessible in all sub folders inside ***utils*** and **.scss*** to make sure I include every SCSS files.

### According to [docs](https://gulpjs.com/)

> Using code over configuration, utilize all of  JavaScript to create your gulp file where tasks can be  written using your own code or chained single purpose plugins.

I can chain my plugins or things I want to do .

```javascript
   return src(Ã­ndex.scss)
        .pipe(sass())
        .pipe(dest('css'))
        .pipe(browserSync.stream())
```
I put the input SCSS file and gently requested to output them in the folder called CSS and make sure its streaming !!

```javascript 
   function watchTask() {
    watch(['./utils/**/*.scss'], buildScss)
    watch('./*.html').on('change', browserSync.reload)
    browserSync.init({
        server: './'
    })
}

```
Compiling SCSS is now ok  and I also have to watch the HTML files to reload every I edit them also and later initialized the browserSync right at my project's root folder.

Export the modules , build and watch straight in the [series](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/api/series/#:~:text=series()-,series(),after%20another%2C%20in%20sequential%20order.).

```javascript
exports.default = series(buildScss, watchTask)
```

Later that I can finally start my development server which fit my needs  for the project.

I prayed and typed in 
```shell
gulp
```

Oh well not bad it's happening.

Till now I got an ideal that would be great if I save this as I SASS , gulp starter kit and I uploaded this on my GitHub with a branch and you can check out [here](https://github.com/Riley1101/scss_gulp_starter).


## On my way to generate my utils


After setup it's time for me to generate my very first utility classes.

### Color utility classes 

With no doubt, I created a file called **_variables.scss** in my utils folder  to store all my base variables like my base color palette, base padding and margin just so I can use them from my various SCSS modules.

> Notice here I have to name my variable file start with underscore to tell SASS that I don't want to generate separate CSS file like variables.css in the output folder.

Here comes my color palette that's I store from bootstrap .

```sass
   $clr-primary: hsl(211, 100%, 50%);
   $clr-secondary:hsl(210, 8%, 46%);
   $clr-success: hsl(133, 62%, 41%);
   $clr-danger: hsl(354, 70%, 54%);
   $clr-warning:hsl(45, 99%, 51%);
   $clr-info: hsl(188, 78%, 40%);
   $clr-light : hsl(220, 27%, 98%);
   $clr-dark:hsl(213, 9%, 23%);
   $clr-white:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
```

I put them all in SCSS variables and thinking a way to transform them to utils classes like  **text-primary-100, text-danger-800** which basically like tailwindCSS.

```sass
$colors : (
    "primary":$clr-primary,
    "secondary":$clr-secondary,
    "error":$clr-danger,
    "warning":$clr-warning,
    "info":$clr-info,
    "light":$clr-light,
    "dark":$clr-dark,
    "white":$clr-white,

    "black":hsl(0, 0%, 0%),
    "red":hsl(0, 100%, 50%),
    "blue":hsl(240, 100%, 50%),
    "green":hsl(120, 100%, 25%),
    "yellow":hsl(60, 100%, 50%),
    "orange":hsl(39, 100%, 50%),
    "purple":hsl(300, 100%, 25%),
    "gray":hsl(0, 0%, 50%),
);

```

Then I add more SCSS object in my variables to generate more color like tailwind.

### _color.scss

Created another file called _color.scss to do all the looping and generating process.

```sass
   @use 'variables' as *;

   @each $key,$val in $colors {
    .text-#{$key}{
        color : $val
    }
    .bg-#{$key}{
        background-color:$val
    }

    .text-hover-#{$key}{
        &:hover{
            color: $val;
        }
    }

    @if($val != white ){
        @for $i from 1 through 9{
            .text-#{$key}-#{100 * $i}{
                color: mix( white,  $val,  $i * 10);
            }
            .bg-#{$key}-#{100 * $i}{
                background-color: mix( white,  $val,  $i * 10);
            }
            .text-hover-#{$key}-#{100 * $i}{
                &:hover{
                    color: mix( white,  $val,  $i * 10);
                }
            }
           
        }
    }
   
}



``` 

To soften color like tailwind I can use SCSS's build in function like mix to mix with the color I want .

```sass
mix(first_clr,second_clr,%)
```

In my case , I want to play around with lightness so I mixed it up with color white and cool I got what I wanted !!!

>I have to make some conditioning to make sure I don't have classes like text-white-200 that would be dumb right?

Make sure you also check for black if you are playing with darkness 

Pretty cool and I am loving the generated css popping up in my file.
And I tried using the classes in my HTML.

Thank you for your time just sharing my journey.

### feel free to suggest.
I am gonna try spacing utils soon.
