### Hello World
Greetings again , here I am  in the episode 2 of trying to generate utility classes with SCSS.

Make sure you check  [the first one](https://dev.to/riley1101/on-my-way-to-generate-css-utils-with-sass--ghn) where Isetup my development environment and generate some color utils.

Here we go !!


### Spacing utilities !!

If you are familiar with CSS utilities like tailwind , you would understand what I am trying to accomplish here !

I want utility classes like p-4 , m-4 , mx , my in my generated CSS .

So I added some base margin and padding values in my ***_variables.scss*** just so I can use them in my generating process.

As I told in my previous [article](https://dev.to/riley1101/on-my-way-to-generate-css-utils-with-sass--ghn)  ***_variables.scss*** is the file where I store all my base variable values.

```sass
    $p-base:0.75rem;
    $m-base:0.75rem;
    $gap-base:0.75rem;
```

### _utilities.scss

In my utils folder , I add a scss file to handle all my generating process and I named it _utilities.scss .

```sass

    // NOTE: _utilities.scss 

    @use 'variables' as *;

```
#### @use 

Hey also I forgot to mention that I am using [@use](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use) in SCSS because @import is [dying](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62757419/whats-the-difference-between-import-and-use-scss-rules). 

In short, @import allows all the stuffs in the file to be accessible throughout the whole project .

> @import makes all variables, mixins, and functions globally accessible. This makes it very difficult for people (or tools) to tell where anything is defined.

>Because everythingâ€™s global, libraries must prefix to all their members to avoid naming collision.

All the naming collisions and as its hard to track where the specific rule comes from . Well I am gonna go with @use.

```sass
   // NOTE: _utilities.scss 

   @use 'variables' as *;

   $utilities:(
     "padding":(
         "prefix":"p",
         "values" : (
            "0":0,
            "1":$p-base * 1,
            "2":$p-base * 2,
            "3":$p-base * 3,
            "4":$p-base * 4,
            "5":$p-base * 5,
            "6":$p-base * 6,
            "7":$p-base * 7,
            "8":$p-base * 8,
            "9":$p-base * 9,
            "10":$p-base * 10,
         ),
     ),  
  );

```
#### .p-4 for padding: px;

We got an object to work with so I checkout the documentation of SCSS for the [flow controls](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/each)

Look what I found !!!

```sass
 $icons: ("eye": "\f112", "start": "\f12e", "stop": "\f12f");

@each $name, $glyph in $icons {
  .icon-#{$name}:before {
    display: inline-block;
    font-family: "Icon Font";
    content: $glyph;
  }
}

```

In SASS, we can loop through the objects !
I started programming with python so it's seem so familiar to me

```python
   data = {'name': "George Costanza", 'quote': "We are living  in the society",}
   for property, value in data.items():
       print(property,value);
```
Cool !!

#### map-get

```sass
// NOTE: accessing values from object in SCSS

$values:("value": 10px);
@debug map-get($map: $values, $key: value)
 
```

```sass
// NOTE: generating spacing utils

@each $property,$map in $utilities {

    $prefix : map-get($map: $map, $key: "prefix");
    $values : map-get($map: $map, $key: "values");

    @each $key,$value in $values {
        .#{$prefix}-#{$key}{
            #{$property}:$value;
        }
    }
}

```
And its done !
I checked the output CSS file and good thing I am seeing these

```css
/* 
... more 
 */
.p-0 {
  padding: 0;
}

.p-1 {
  padding: 0.75rem;
}

.p-2 {
  padding: 1.5rem;
}

.p-3 {
  padding: 2.25rem;
}

/* 
... and more 
 */

```
We got the padding and now  for the rest all we have to do is add more values to our utility object.

```scss 

$utilities:(
    "padding":(
        "prefix":"p",
        "values" : (
            //    values
        ),
    ),
    "padding-right":(
        "prefix":"pr",
        "values" : (
            //    values
        ),
    ),

    // goes with top,right,bottom,left,

    "padding-inline":(
        "prefix":"px",
        "values" : (
            //    values
        ),
    ),
    "padding-block":(
        "prefix":"py",
        "values" : (
            // values
        ),
    ),
    "margin":(
        "prefix":"m",
        "values" : (
            // values
        ),
    ),

    // goes with top,right,bottom,left,

    "margin-inline":(
        "prefix":"mx",
        "values" : (
            // values
        ),
    ),
    "margin-block":(
        "prefix":"my",
        "values" : (
            //    values
        ),
    ),
);

```
I should have use better way for my values but that's fine I ended up with ctrl+c  and ctrl+v .

###@forward to spit out all my _partials

Currently now I have multiple partials in my utils folder ,good thing i can somehow gather them in a single file and spit out all these property together in a single index file .

So in my index.scss file 

```sass

@forward '_colors';
@forward '_variables';
@forward '_utilities';

```

And that's how its done ! 

No :( almost forgot I also created a partial file _base.scss just so I can remove all the browser's default styles .

```scss
body{
    margin: 0;
    font-family: 'Nunito';
}

ul,ol{
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
}

a{
    text-decoration: none;
}

*,*::before,*::after{
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Don't worry we gonna check out the _base.scss later in the series.
This is what my final index.scss looks like 

```sass
@forward '_base';
@forward '_variables';
@forward '_colors';
@forward '_utilities';

```

This is the episode of me trying to learn more about SCSS while generating CSS utils .
